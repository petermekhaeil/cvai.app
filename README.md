## How it works

This site uses OpenAI‚Äôs new [GPT-4 with Vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) model.
It first converts the PDF to an image, constructs a prompt based on the resume and the job description, sends it to GPT-4 API, then streams the response back to the application.
